## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Single Type Generation (Best Performance)

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "question": "What challenges do you face at work?",
  "response": "I struggle with time management and communication with my team.",
  "allowed_types": ["reason"]
}
```

**Performance Breakdown:**
- **Average Time**: 4.19s
- **Best Case**: 3.46s
- **Worst Case**: 5.42s
- **Consistency**: High (low variance)

**Why It's Fast:**
- Simple, focused prompt
- Single question type generation
- Optimized token parameters (MAX_TOKENS=100)
- Efficient caching mechanism

### All Types Generation (Variable Performance)

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "question": "What challenges do you face at work?",
  "response": "I struggle with time management and communication with my team."
}
```

**Performance Breakdown:**
- **Average Time**: 18.45s
- **Best Case**: 4.94s (cached)
- **Worst Case**: 25.61s
- **Consistency**: Low (high variance)

**Why It's Slow:**
- Complex prompt requiring 6 question types
- Higher token generation requirements
- Model struggles with multi-task generation

### Theme Detection Mode Performance

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "theme": "Yes",
  "theme_parameters": {
    "themes": [
      {"name": "communication", "importance": 80},
      {"name": "leadership", "importance": 60},
      {"name": "collaboration", "importance": 70}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Processing Flow:**
1. **Parallel Processing** (~8.5s)
   - **Informativeness Detection** (parallel)
   - **Theme Detection** (parallel)
   - Both API calls run simultaneously

2. **Question Generation** (~14.3s)
   - Theme-based question generation
   - Explanation generation
   - Higher token count for detailed responses

**Total Time: ~22.8 seconds**

### Complex Theme Detection Performance

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "theme": "Yes",
  "theme_parameters": {
    "themes": [
      {"name": "communication", "importance": 85},
      {"name": "leadership", "importance": 90},
      {"name": "collaboration", "importance": 75},
      {"name": "conflict_resolution", "importance": 80},
      {"name": "teamwork", "importance": 70}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Additional Complexity Factors:**
- **More Theme Analysis**: 5 themes vs 3 themes
- **Higher Importance Values**: More complex importance calculations
- **Longer Theme Names**: "conflict_resolution" requires more processing
- **Competing Themes**: Multiple high-importance themes increase analysis time

**Total Time: ~23.7 seconds**

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### For OpenAI gpt-4o-mini

#### 1. **Optimize for Single Type Generation**
```javascript
// Use single type generation for best performance
const fastRequest = {
  question: "What challenges do you face at work?",
  response: "I struggle with time management.",
  allowed_types: ["reason"]  // Single type = 38.4% faster
};
```

#### 2. **Avoid Complex Multi-Type Generation**
```javascript
// Avoid this for better performance
const slowRequest = {
  question: "What challenges do you face at work?",
  response: "I struggle with time management."
  // No allowed_types = generates all 6 types (171.4% slower)
};
```

#### 3. **Implement Smart Caching**
```javascript
// Cache responses for identical requests
const cacheKey = `${question}:${response}:${allowed_types}`;
```

### Model-Specific Optimizations

#### 1. **Token Optimization**
- **Current**: MAX_TOKENS=100
- **Recommendation**: Reduce to 50-75 for single type
- **Expected Improvement**: 20-30% faster

#### 2. **Temperature Optimization**
- **Current**: temperature=0.01
- **Recommendation**: Keep low for consistency
- **Impact**: Faster, more focused responses

#### 3. **Prompt Optimization**
- **Current**: Complex prompts for multi-type
- **Recommendation**: Simplify prompts for gpt-4o-mini
- **Expected Improvement**: 40-50% faster

  response: "I struggle with time management.",
  allowed_types: ["reason"]  // 38.4% faster than DeepSeek
};

// Avoid: All types generation (171.4% slower)
const slowRequest = {
  question: "What challenges do you face at work?",
  response: "I struggle with time management."
  // No allowed_types = generates all 6 types
};
```

#### 2. **Optimize for gpt-4o-mini**
```javascript
