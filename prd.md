# Survey Intelligence API - MVP Product Overview

## Product Description

The Survey Intelligence API MVP is a lightweight solution that automatically generates intelligent follow-up questions for open-ended survey responses. Using AI-powered analysis, it helps survey creators gather deeper insights by suggesting relevant follow-up questions based on respondent answers.

## MVP Problem Statement

Traditional surveys often collect shallow responses because:
- Survey creators can't anticipate all response variations for follow-ups
- Manual analysis of responses for follow-ups is time-consuming
- Static follow-up questions don't adapt to individual responses
- Missed opportunities to gather deeper insights from respondents

## MVP Solution

Our API MVP provides:
- **Real-time Response Analysis**: Analyzes user responses using DeepSeek LLM
- **Intelligent Question Generation**: Creates 2-3 contextually relevant follow-up questions
- **Multiple Question Types**: Supports 6 core follow-up strategies
- **Simple REST API**: Easy integration with any system via HTTP requests
