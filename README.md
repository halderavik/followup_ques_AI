# Survey Intelligence API - MVP

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based REST API that generates intelligent follow-up questions for open-ended survey responses using DeepSeek LLM. It is designed for easy integration with survey platforms and provides exactly 3 contextually relevant follow-up questions per response with specific types: Reason, Example, and Impact. The API also includes enhanced multilingual support with informativeness detection and **theme-enhanced analysis**.

## Features

- **Exactly 3 follow-up questions** with specific types: Reason, Example, Impact
- **Enhanced multilingual support** with informativeness detection
- **üÜï Theme-enhanced analysis** - detects themes in responses and generates contextually relevant questions
- **Informativeness detection** - automatically detects non-informative responses (e.g., "I don't know", "no")
- **Theme detection and ranking** - identifies themes by importance and generates targeted questions
- Simple REST API (JSON)
- No authentication required for users
- Comprehensive error handling
- Intelligent follow-up question generation
- Type mapping and fallback mechanisms for reliable output
- Support for multiple languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Korean)

## Tech Stack

## üöÄ Live Deployment
**Production URL:** `https://follow-up-question-f00b29aae45c.herokuapp.com/`

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment:
   ```bash
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Windows Command Prompt
   .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your DeepSeek API key:
   ```env
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit your actual API key to Git. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`.
6. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
7. Test the API:
   ```bash
   # API information
   curl http://localhost:5000/
   
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   
   # Get question types
   curl http://localhost:5000/question-types
   
   # Generate follow-up questions
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate-followup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"question": "What did you think?", "response": "It was good."}'
   ```
