# Survey Intelligence API - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Survey Intelligence API is a fully functional Flask-based REST API that generates intelligent follow-up questions for survey responses using DeepSeek LLM. The API is designed to help survey creators gather deeper insights by automatically suggesting relevant follow-up questions based on respondent answers.

## ✅ Current Status: MVP Complete

### Core Features Implemented

1. **AI-Powered Question Generation**
   - DeepSeek LLM integration with correct API endpoint
   - Intelligent prompt engineering for context-aware questions
   - Support for 6 question types: reason, clarification, elaboration, example, impact, comparison

2. **REST API Endpoints**
   - `GET /` - API information and endpoint overview
   - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
   - `GET /question-types` - List all supported question types
   - `POST /generate-followup` - Generate intelligent follow-up questions

3. **User-Friendly Architecture**
   - No authentication required for users
   - DeepSeek API key configured server-side only
   - Simple JSON request/response format
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Flask 2.3.3 with modular architecture
   - Pydantic models for data validation
   - Python 3.11 virtual environment
   - Comprehensive logging and error handling
   - Unit tests with custom test runner

## 🚀 API Usage Examples

### Generate Follow-up Questions
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate-followup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What did you think of our service?",
    "response": "The service was good but could be faster."
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "followups": [
    {
      "text": "What specifically about the service made you feel it could be faster?",
      "type": "reason"
    },
    {
      "text": "How did the speed of the service affect your overall experience?",
      "type": "impact"
    },
    {
      "text": "How does the speed of our service compare to similar services you've used?",
      "type": "comparison"
    }
  ]
}
```

### With Specific Question Types
```json
{
  "question": "How satisfied are you with our product?",
  "response": "I am satisfied with the features but the price is too high.",
  "allowed_types": ["reason", "example", "impact"]
}
```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your DeepSeek API key
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Test API**
   - Browser: `http://localhost:5000/`
